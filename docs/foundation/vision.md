# Vision — The Self-Building Company

## Mission

Build a self-building, agent-run company that autonomously plans, ships, operates, and improves category-defining products — starting with specialty coffee — where mastery requires capturing scarce, embodied knowledge.

## Core Value: Autonomous Operation

- **Company as system:** Agents plan → build → operate → learn. Humans define intent, ethics, and capital — not every low-level decision.
- **Visible loop:** Every operation follows the 5-step loop:
  1. Get Mission
  2. Scan the Scene
  3. Think It Through
  4. Take Action
  5. Observe & Iterate

  This loop should be evident in:
  - API design,
  - logs/traces (one trace per loop),
  - and UI elements (e.g. a timeline of steps for each mission).

- **Capability ladder:** We ship at **L2** (recommend/assist), and only promote to:
  - **L3:** act with explicit approval,
  - **L4:** act with veto,
  when evaluations show safety and benefit.

- **Autonomy KPIs:**
  - % of tasks completed by agents,
  - time-to-improvement for key metrics,
  - human intervention rate,
  - audit trail completeness and quality.

- **Simulation-first:** No increase in autonomy level without wins in:
  - the digital twin (simulation), and
  - limited live canaries.

- **Ethics & provenance:**
  - signed telemetry,
  - reversible participation (users can leave with their data),
  - transparent ownership & licensing.

Autonomy at scale requires secure execution sandboxes for any agent-operated software/data work.  
Agents that need a workspace (files, shells, toolchains) run in isolated sandboxes with strict limits, while API-only agents remain normal services.

## Why this matters

- Generic app features will be absorbed into foundation models.
- Durable advantage comes from **operating real workflows** with high-signal feedback loops.
- Craft/physics-heavy domains (coffee roasting, fermentation, cacao, tea…) are still intuition-driven; we can systematize mastery without erasing craft.

## We are / We are not

**We are:**
- a self-improving organism: product → data → intelligence → better product.
- agent-operated by default.

**We are not:**
- a data broker (data is fuel, not the main product),
- an agency/consultancy,
- a generic “do everything” platform.

## 10-year picture

A company that can:
1. choose a vertical,
2. build the best tool in it,
3. run the operation autonomously,
4. and compound advantage through embodied intelligence—

repeatable across multiple craft-heavy domains.
