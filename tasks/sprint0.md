# Sprint 0 — Walking Skeleton

Goal: have a simulated roast mission run end-to-end:

- mission created,
- agent loop runs (Think→Act→Observe),
- simulated roaster produces telemetry,
- desktop app displays curve + loop timeline,
- evaluation runs,
- trace & audit trail are complete.

## Tasks

1. Repo scaffold & tooling
2. Shared schemas package
3. Agent runtime library
4. Company kernel service
5. Ingestion service
6. Simulation/twin service (stub)
7. Scientist agent (eval harness)
8. Roaster desktop app (shell)
9. Simulated roaster driver
10. Observability stack

Each of these tasks should be implemented incrementally with tests and aligned with `docs/engineering/llm-coding-rules.md`.
